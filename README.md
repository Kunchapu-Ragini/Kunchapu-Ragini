My name is Ragini K, and I'm a dedicated VLSI enthusiast. 🚀
Embarking on a challenging 100-day journey focused on RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and verification using Verilog. 💻
Throughout this journey, I primarily utilize Xilinx Vivado software for RTL code simulation. 🛠️
This exciting endeavor allows me to deepen my expertise in the field and explore various aspects of VLSI design. 🌟
